#Problem:
  With the demand of quality life rising, where a fresh brand of fast food restaurant would be settled, with highest profit and sufficient customers, is a  problem worth solving. 

#Data preparation
  In terms of the brand-new fast food, the restaurant, in my opinion, is supposed to be settled in the residential area and with not too far proximity to CBD, in order to gain more publicity and exposure. 
Hence, we should have the distribution of residential area location and CBD, also the population moving around the street or mall.

  On the other side, we have to avoid the relentless brunt or business competition. Therefore, we have to get distribution of  chain fast food.
